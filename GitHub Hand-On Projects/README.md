# Practice Project: Mastering Git and GitHub
Overview
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with Git and GitHub. It includes practical exercises to help you master essential skills.
Practice Project - Scenario & Overview
Estimated Time: 15 minutes

## Scenario
You have recently joined a logistics company seeking to enhance its supply chain management process by creating a shipping calculator web application. The company's objective is to establish a robust, efficient, and transparent system for calculating shipping costs and providing delivery estimates to its customers.

In today's dynamic business environment, collaboration and knowledge sharing are crucial in advancing research and fostering growth.

Within this company, multiple teams are concurrently working on different products. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure seamless collaboration, effective version control, and efficient project management. The company has decided to use GitHub as its web-based interface.

Your assignment involves harnessing GitHub's collaborative and version control features to oversee the development and deployment of the shipping calculator web application. This initiative aims to lead to an optimized supply chain management process.


## Overview:
This practice project consists of two parts.

### Part 1: Using GitHub UI
You are asked to host the starter code of your company to calculate shipping logistics rates on GitHub in a new repository as the first step. You will not only host the script but also follow the best practices introduced in this course and create supporting documents for the open source project, including a code of conduct and contributing guidelines. Additionally, the repository should be available to the community under the Apache License 2.0.

This will be done on the GitHub UI.

### Part 2: Using GitHub CLI
You have successfully started your company's journey with GitHub by creating a repository for the Shipping Calculator application. All the developers have contributed, and their changes have been accepted and merged into a new global repository: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/Centralized-repository-shipping_calculations.git. Now, you have been asked to edit some of the codes and also add few more files. For this, you will fork this global repository, make the necessary edits, and add files using Git CLI in the provided lab environment. Finally, you will open a pull request to contribute your changes to the global repository.

This will be done on the CLI.
