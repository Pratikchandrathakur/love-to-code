In this example:

personJSON encapsulates information about an individual with fields such as name, age, email, address, tags, isStudent, and workExperience.
The address field is an embedded JSON object within the main JSON object.
The tags field is an array containing strings.
isStudent is a boolean value, and workExperience is null.
JSON.stringify() converts the JavaScript object personJSON into a JSON string.
In JSON, enclose both keys and values in double quotation marks.
The resulting output of console.log(jsonString) will be a string representation of the JSON object.
