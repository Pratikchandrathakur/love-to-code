## The Spread Operator
When it comes to arrays, you can add them together:
```
const groceryList = ["apples", "bananas", "milk", "eggs"];
const householdItems = ["paper towels", "dish soap", "toothpaste"];

const combinedList = [groceryList, householdItems];

console.log(combinedList);

/* Output:
[
  [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'milk', 'eggs' ],
  [ 'paper towels', 'dish soap', 'toothpaste' ]
]
*/
```
Oh wait... the output is an array of two arrays. How can we combine them into a single array? We can use a handy tool called a spread operator!

The spread operator lets you "unpack" items out of collections, like array elements or object properties, for use in other places. This allows us to do cool things, such as:

Apply zero or more arguments to a function.
Unpack items and add them to another array or object.
To use the spread operator, we use three ... periods on the left side of the array name.

From our last example, we can return a single array of the combined content with the spread operator:
```
const combinedList = [...groceryList, ...householdItems];

console.log(combinedList);

/*
Output: 
[
  'apples',
  'bananas',
  'milk',
  'eggs',
  'paper towels',
  'dish soap',
  'toothpaste'
]
*/
```
Much better! The spread operator took everything out of the groceryList and householdItems arrays and placed them in a new combinedList array.

## The Rest Operator
We can also use those same three dots to "pack" items into arrays and objects.

The rest operator collects zero or more items into objects or arrays, that can be used for things like:

Defining functions with zero or more parameters.
Help with destructuring arrays and objects.
If we're defining a function but aren't sure how many arguments it should take, we can use the rest operator:
```
const packGroceries = (...items) => {
  return items;
}

const packedGroceries = packGroceries("apples", "bananas", "milk");
const morePackedGroceries = packGroceries("eggs", "bread");

console.log(packedGroceries);
console.log(morePackedGroceries);
/*
Output:
[ 'apples', 'bananas', 'milk' ]
[ 'eggs', 'bread' ]
*/
```
## Instructions
Let's practice these nifty new operators by planning an intercontinental vacation! üó∫Ô∏è

Define a planVacation() function that returns a string array of destinations we plan to visit. It should accept at least two string arguments:
destinationOne
destinationTwo
Use the rest operator so the planVacation() function can have more arguments passed to it.

Then, execute the planVacation() function and log the results to the console.
Where in the world will you plan for next?
