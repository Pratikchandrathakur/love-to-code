# 01. Introduction
## ES6
It's time to turn the knobs up a notch. ‚è´

In 2015, a major shift in how we write modern JavaScript occurred with the release of ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6). This led to features such as:

Making functions in a more concise way.
Writing strings with variables inside of them.
Using spread and rest operators for arrays and objects.
Using promises for asynchronous operations (next chapter).
Over time, the syntax from ES6 has helped us write cleaner, clearer JavaScript code.

In this chapter, we'll start learning some ES6 syntax that includes arrow functions, template literals, and the for...of and for...in loops.

Note: If you're using let and const for variables, you're already writing in ES6! üòÄ
