// 🕺 TGIF-->Medium
// In many parts of the world, we look forward to Friday to kick off a weekend of leisure. Some express this with "TGIF" (short for "Thank God It's Friday").

// Let's use conditionals to tell if the weekend is upon us!

// First, define a day variable with a number between 1 and 7. So 1 represents Monday, 2 represents Tuesday, and so on.

// Based on the value of a day variable, use conditionals to log one of the following:

// If it's a weekday, log "Not Friday, yet!"
// If it's Friday, log "TGIF 🕺".
// If it's a weekend, log "Yay, weekends! 🙌".
// Otherwise, log "Wait, what day is it?"

// Write code below 💖

constday=5

if(day<5){
  console.log("Not Friday, yet!")
}
else if(day===5){
  console.log("TGIF 🕺")
}
else if(day>5){
  console.log("Yay, weekends! 🙌")
}
else{
  console.log("Wait, what day is it?")
}
