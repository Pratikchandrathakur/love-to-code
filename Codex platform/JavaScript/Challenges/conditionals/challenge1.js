// ðŸ¦‰ Nite Owl-->Easy
// People tend to be either an early bird or a night owl. There are several factors that go into this, such as genetics, age, lifestyle, and more.

// Let's use conditionals to see which one you are!

// Start by creating a wakeUp variable and set it equal to the time you wake up, between 0 and 23.

// Test for early bird vs. night owl with an if/else statement:

// wakeUp is < 8, log "Early bird gets the worm! ðŸŒ…"
// Otherwise, log "But who wants the worm? ðŸŒƒ"

// Write code below ðŸ’–

const wakeUp=5;

if (wakeUp <8){
  console.log("Early bird gets the worm!  ðŸŒ…")
}
else{
  console.log("But who wants the worm? ðŸŒƒ");
}
