"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

Create a family_tree.html file for your family using list elements such as <ul> and <li> elements. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

If you are stuck, try doing one for the British Royal Family, the Kardashians, or the Simpsons.

Once you are done, ask yourself:

Which elements are parents?
Which elements are children?
Which elements are siblings?
Note: Remember to set up your web page properly. (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, etc.)-->
