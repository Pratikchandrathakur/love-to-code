<!-- Instructions
For the last exercise, let's build a form page for a new website called "Welp!"

It's a review site like Yelp, which is well-known for its reviews of restaurants by foodies. Instead of food reviews, Welp can be about reviewing anything from books to film to public parks!

Create a new file called welp.html.

After setting up the file, add a <form> element in the <body>.

Let's include this information (in order):

The reviewer's name (first, last, nickname, doesn't matter).*
The name of what they're reviewing (film name, book title, etc.).*
Three "radio" buttons that ask if the reviewer would try/visit again.
An <input> to offer a rating (1 out of 5).*
A <textarea> element for the reviewer to write comments (no more than 250 characters).
An input type of "submit" that says "Submit Review".
The inputs with * are required.

Make sure to add labels and validate the inputs! -->
