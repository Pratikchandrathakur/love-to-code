<!-- Instructions
For this exercise, we are going to recreate one of the most notable forms on the Internet: the original Google search bar!

Create a new file called google.html.

Copy and paste the following code into an editor:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Form code goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

Next, let's replace the comment with a <form> element. For now, we can either set the action and method attributes to nothing, "", or just not add them.

Then, add these elements:

A <p> paragraph element that reads "Search the web using Google!".
An <input> element with the type set to "text", followed by a <br> line break element.
Another <input> element, but with this one's type is set to "submit" (its text should say "Google Search".
Note: If we submit this form, nothing will really happen because we haven't told the form where to send the data. -->

  <!-- Write code below ðŸ’– -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Google</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form action="" method="">
      <p>Search the web using Google!</p>
      </form>
      <input type="text" /><br/>
      <input type="submit" value="Google Search"
  </body>
</html>
