Craigslist is a website that looks straight out of the 90s. That's because it has stayed roughly the same!

It was started by Craig Newark in 1995 as an email list for his San Francisco friends. Today, the company does over $1 billion a year in revenue while operating from a tiny office. 🤯

Here’s a screenshot of a Craigslist ad:

Craigslist ad for a used Didgeridoo

Craig needs some help with the codebase. Can you help him clean up some HTML using what you learned about comments and formatting?

Here’s the code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
     <!-- Hi, it’s Craig! Can you add “For Sale” in the title below? -->
    <title>Didgeridoo. Needs work</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Add some comments below to document what each line means! -->
    <h2>Didgeridoo. Needs work</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrXO7Sa.png" width="250">
    <p>Australian Aboriginal Didgeridoo. Needs work. Free to good home</p>

    <!-- Add the bullet point in the picture and then uncomment the code below! -->
    <!-- <ul>
      <li>Something should go here</li>
    </ul> -->
  </body>
</html>

Create a craigslist_ad.html file and copy and paste this in. Don't touch anything yet!

Run this file to see what it looks like.

Now, edit the HTML based on the comments and help Craig finish the code! 🧹

<!-- Write code below 💖 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <!-- Appropriate heading and image aligned for ad -->
    <h2>Didgeridoo. Needs work</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TrXO7Sa.png" width="250">
    <p>Australian Aboriginal Didgeridoo. Needs work. Free to good home</p>

    <!-- Add the bullet point in the picture and then uncomment the code below! -->
    <ul>
