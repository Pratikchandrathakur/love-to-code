<!-- Final Project
Congratulations on finishing all of the chapters in The Origins I: HTML! Now let’s use the skills we’ve gained throughout the course to build out a fun Restaurant Menu website.

Restaurant Menu
In this Final Project, you'll create a page of a full fledged restaurant menu that includes a form for placing an order!

Create a new file called restaurant_menu.html.

You can be as creative as you want with the name and menu items for the restaurant; it can be real or fictional. However, you should include the following:

The HTML file should be properly structured (Hint: start with <!DOCTYPE html>).

A <title> element with the restaurant name should be included in the <head> element.

A header section that features:

An image with an id of "header-img".
A <h1> heading element with the name of the restaurant.
A navigation section with two headings for "#menu" and "#order-form".
A main section for the menu and order form, featuring:

Two sections, each with a <h2> heading that says "Menu" and "Place Your Order".
The "Menu" section should have at least three <article> elements for the menu items that use the following elements:
An <img> image element.
A <h3> element for the name of the menu item.
A <p> paragraph element that briefly describes the item (1-2 sentences) and includes price information (italicized).
The "Place Your Order" section must include a <form> element with the following inputs:
Number inputs for each menu item (make sure to validate input with a minimum of 0).
Radio and/or checkbox inputs for things like sides and add-ons.
At least one <textarea> element for one of the items (for special requests).
A submit input that says "Go To Checkout".
Note: Make sure to include a <label> element for each <input> element.
A footer that includes a <p> paragraph element that reads "Made with love by " followed by your Codédex username.

Bonus: Please feel free to use the style attribute or <style> element to give your menu some flair! Revisit the "Power Rangers" challenge for a refresher.
