 You've found a hidden letter! ðŸ¦„
 Dear learner,

 I embarked on my coding journey in 2010 when I enrolled in a C/C++ course in college, not knowing what it meant nor where it could possibly take me.

 In the past ten years, programming has brought tremendous joy to my life and I met so many amazing friends through it.
 I'm incredibly jelly of where you are right now because I would do this all over again in a heartbeat.

 Thank you for learning Python with us. I canâ€™t wait to see what you do with it.
