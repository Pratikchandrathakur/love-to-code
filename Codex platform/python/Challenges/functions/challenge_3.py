# ðŸŽ® KDA Ratio-->Easy
# In some online multiplayer games, there's a KDA ratio to evaluate a player's in-game performance:

# KDA=(k+a)/d

# k is how many players you took down.
# d is how many times you died.
# a is how many assists you had.
# Write a kda() function that takes in parameters: k, d, a.

# This function should calculate and return the KDA ratio that uses these paremeters.

# Write code below ðŸ’–

def kda(k,d,a):
  KDA=(k+a)/d
  return KDA

print(kda(4,3,2))
