# 🎒 High School Grades -->Easy
# U.S. high schools typically last for four years, from freshman year to senior year. 🚌💨

# First, ask the user to enter their grade as an integer.

# Create a four-year high school grade system using an if/elif/else statement:

# grade is 9, print 'Freshman'
# grade is 10, print 'Sophomore'
# grade is 11, print 'Junior'
# grade is 12, print 'Senior'
# Everything else is 'TBD'
# Write code below 💖

grade=int(input("Enter your Grade in integer"))
if grade==9:
  print('Freshman')
elif grade==10:
  print('Sophomore')
elif grade==11:
  print('Junior')
elif grade==12:
  print('Senior')
else:
  print('TBD')
