# 🗓️ Seasons of the Year -->Medium
# Ah, the four seasons in the year — winter, spring, summer, or fall; all you have to do is call!

# Ask the user the month number using the input() function.

# Check for the four seasons using an if/elif/else statement and logical operators:

# month is 1, 2, 3, print 'Winter 🌨️'
# month is 4, 5, 6, print 'Spring 🌱'
# month is 7, 8, 9, print 'Summer 🌻'
# month is 10, 11, 12, print 'Autumn 🍂'
# Everything else is 'Invalid'
# Logical operators in Python include the and and or keywords. Which one should you use?



# Write code below 💖
month=int(input("Enter the months number you want to check season for "))

if month==1 or month==2 or month==3:
  print('Winter 🌨️')
elif month==4 or month==5 or month==6:
  print( 'Spring 🌱')
elif month==7 or month== 8 or month== 9:
  print('Summer 🌻')
elif month==10 or month==11 or month==12:
  print('Autumn 🍂')
else:
  print("Invalid")
