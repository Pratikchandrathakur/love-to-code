# ðŸ¥³ New Year Countdown-->Medium
# Ring in the New Year! A New Year's Eve party doesn't feel complete without a countdown from 10 to 1.

# Use a for loop and the range() function for a countdown.

# The output should look like:

# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
# Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³

# Counting down from 10 to 1 on each line and then a Happy New Year message at the end.

# Note: Feel free to end your message with any emoji you want!
# Write code below ðŸ’–
for count in range(10,0,-1):
  print(count)
print('Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³')
