# 🏆 The Oscars-->Medium
# Every year at the Oscars, the Academy Award for Best Picture is awarded to a single film. It's usually the last award presented and is considered to be the most prestigious.

# Let's use a Python list to document the recent winners!

# Start with the following list:

# best_pictures = [
#   '2019 - Parasite',
#   '2018 - Green Book',
#   '2017 - The Shape of Water',
#   '2016 - Moonlight',
#   '2015 - Spotlight',
#   '2014 - Birdman',
#   '2013 - 12 Years a Slave',
#   '2012 - Argo',
#   '2011 - The Artist',
#   '2010 - The King\'s Speech'
# ]

# Google the Best Picture winners from 2020, 2021, and 2022. Then, add them to the front of the best_pictures list.

# Lastly, print the best_pictures list. Make sure that the updated list starts with the winner for 2022, then 2021, then 2020, and so on.
