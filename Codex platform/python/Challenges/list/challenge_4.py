# ðŸ§¾ Split the Bill-->Medium
# Suppose you and three of your friends all went out for a meal together. The bill comes due, and all of you decide to split the bill evenly.

# Here is a Python list of prices for what was ordered:

# bill = [13.99, 28.75, 9.99, 9.99, 6.95, 7.45, 16.45, 16.45]

# Using this bill list, calculate the total amount and then divide it four ways.

# Initialize the total with zero and loop through the bill list to add everything up.

# With the total, store what each person has to pay in a my_share variable and then print the result to the terminal.

# Write code below ðŸ’–
bill = [13.99, 28.75, 9.99, 9.99, 6.95, 7.45, 16.45, 16.45]
total=0
for amount in bill:
  total+=amount
print(total)
my_share=total/4
print(my_share)
