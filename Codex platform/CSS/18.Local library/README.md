# 18. Local Library
## Congrats!

### We've made it to the final exercise of this chapter! ðŸŽ‰

Let's recap what was learned about the box model:

It describes the layers of boxes that surround each element on the page.
The padding box is directly outside of the content.
The border box is the outer edge of an element, and can be rounded or made visible.
The margin box separates an element from other elements.
There are two box-sizing modes, content-box and border-box, that determine how elements are sized by the width and height properties.
In this final exercise, we're going to use our knowledge of the box model to style a homepage for a library. ðŸ“š
