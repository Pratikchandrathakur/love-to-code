# Congrats!
Congratulations on making it to the end of the CSS course! üéä

We covered a lot in just this chapter alone, including:

Setting how elements appear on the screen with the display property.
Understanding how elements follow a normal flow on the page, by default.
Using the position to place elements elsewhere on the page (either inside or outside the normal flow).
Instructions
Let's use everything we've learned out of CSS layout and make an image gallery for a museum website! üñºÔ∏è

Here, we will start with the code found in this folder. Feel free to paste the code from these files either to here or your preferred code editor.

Inside the index.html file, below the <hr> element, create 4-8 copies of the following <img> elements populated with images from the `images/ folder:

<img src="" alt="" class= "gallery-item" id="item-1">

Note: Each <img> should have an id counting up from 1 (item-1, item-2, etc.).

Next, inside of the styles.css file, rearrange the content using what you learned about CSS layout.

Things to think about include:

The display property (block vs. inline vs. inline-block).
A absolute position for one of the elements (displaced, out of flow).
A relative position for one of the elements (displaced, in flow).
A fixed position for one of the elements (stuck, out of flow).
A sticky position for one of the elements (stuck, in flow).
Other than that, be as creative as your heart will let you. ‚ô•Ô∏è

And don't forget to share a screenshot of your finished design to Twitter and tag @codedex_io!
